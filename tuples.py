# Tuple
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# Tuples are written with round brackets.

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Create a Tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

# Tuple Items
# Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

# Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

# Ordered
# When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

# Unchangeable
# Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

# Allow Duplicates
# Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

# Example
# Tuples allow duplicate values:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

# Tuple Length
# To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function:

# Example
# Print the number of items in the tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))

# Create Tuple With One Item
# To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.

# Example
# One item tuple, remember the comma:

thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

# NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))

# Tuple Items - Data Types
# Tuple items can be of any data type:

# Example
# String, int and boolean data types:

tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)
print(tuple1)
print(tuple2)
print(tuple3)

tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")

print(tuple1)

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(type(mytuple))

# The tuple() Constructor
# It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.

# Example
# Using the tuple() method to make a tuple:

# note the double round-brackets
thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
print(thistuple)

# Access Tuple Items
# You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Print the second item in the tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[1])

# Negative Indexing
# Negative indexing means start from the end.

# -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

# Example
# Print the last item of the tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[-1])

# Range of Indexes
# You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.

# When specifying a range, the return value will be a new tuple with the specified items.

# Example
# Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
print(thistuple[2:5])

# Remember that the first item has index 0.

# By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:

# Example
# This example returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT included, "kiwi":

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
print(thistuple[:4])

# Example
# This example returns the items from "cherry" and to the end:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
print(thistuple[2:])

# Change Tuple Values
# Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

# But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)

# Add Items
# Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a build-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items to a tuple.

# 1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple.

# Example
# Convert the tuple into a list, add "orange", and convert it back into a tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.append("orange")
thistuple = tuple(y)

print(thistuple)

# 2. Add tuple to a tuple. You are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:

# Example
# Create a new tuple with the value "orange", and add that tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = ("orange",)
thistuple += y

print(thistuple)
