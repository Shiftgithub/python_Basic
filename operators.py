# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
print(10 + 5)

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# +	Addition	x + y
# -	Subtraction	x - y
# *	Multiplication	x * y
# /	Division	x / y
# %	Modulus	x % y
# **	Exponentiation	x ** y
# //	Floor division	x // y

# Operator	Example	Same As
# =	x = 5	x = 5
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3


# Operator	Name	Example
# ==	Equal	x == y
# !=	Not equal	x != y
# >	Greater than	x > y
# <	Less than	x < y
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

# Operator	Description	Example
# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)
x = 5

print(not (x > 3 and x < 10))

# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

# Operator	Description	Example
# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is z)

# returns True because z is the same object as x

print(x is y)

# returns False because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content

print(x == y)

# to demonstrate the difference betweeen "is" and "==": this comparison returns True because x is equal to y

# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is not z)

# returns False because z is the same object as x

print(x is not y)

# returns True because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content

print(x != y)

# to demonstrate the difference betweeen "is not" and "!=": this comparison returns False because x is equal to y

# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

# Operator	Description	Example	Try it
# in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y

# Python Bitwise Operators
# Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

# Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
# & 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	x & y	
# |	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	x | y	
# ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	x ^ y	
# ~	NOT	Inverts all the bits	~x	
# <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	x << 2	
# >>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	x >> 2

# Operator Precedence
# Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

# Example
# Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:

print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

# Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:

print(100 + 5 * 3)

# The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

# Operator	Description	Try it
# ()	Parentheses	
# **	Exponentiation	
# +x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
# *  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
# +  -	Addition and subtraction	
# <<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts	
# &	Bitwise AND	
# ^	Bitwise XOR	
# |	Bitwise OR	
# ==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
# not	Logical NOT	
# and	AND	
# or	OR

# If two operators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right.

# Example
# Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:

print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
